When optimizing the routing of hazardous material, typically several objectives have to be taken into account. Not only do we want to minimize the cost of all transports as in classical vehicle routing problems but also the risks the population are exposed to. Moreover, it is often desired to also distribute the risks equitable over the population and the environment. In order to solve this three-objective optimization problem and to deal with the large search spaces and non-linear objective functions occurring in practical applications, this project aims at developing efficient algorithms which are stochastic (in terms of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithms) and at the same time contain problem-specific parts (in terms of hybrid metaheuristics).
